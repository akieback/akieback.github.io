On this website you can find the NYC Taxi dataset. This dataset displays a random taxi during a day. It shows the stored coordinates of the taxi on a map of New York. It highlights the routes where the taxi was driving a passenger to his/her destination. I think this dataset is interesting because, if you can see all the taxis all over New York, you can analyze where NYC residents are during the day and use that data to create an evacuation plan.

Books:
The book I´m most interested in is called "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray (2013). This book is a kind of Step-By-Step guide to get started with data visualization. It gives a brief introduction to Javascript, HTML and CSS. It will provide the reader with many different example projects to get started.  
I´m interested in this book because I think that Big Data is useless if you are not able to visualize your results. It will always be important to know how to present the analyzed results out of hugh datasets.
