So what is GitHub? Github is a software using git and is designed to work as a cloud version of Git. The key functions are " branch", "pull", "commit", "push request", "repository", "merge" and "clone". First of all, you can create a repository which is a folder where everyone in your team can work on a project together. The "commit" function is a record of all changes ever made to the project. With that you can always see what has been changed and by whom. A Clone is a offline copy of the repository on your local device. That allows you to work offline on your project. Another important function is the branch function. There you can edit or implement new features. Those edits will have no effect on your main branch so you can test the new features without risking a fallout. To merge the branches you start a pull request so everyone can check on your code and maybe give suggestions for improvement. After the Team approved your code, then you can merge the main branch with your branch, so the new feature is live and everyone can use it. As you can see, GitHub is especially helpful for teams working on one project.

As already explained in the section above: A "clone" is a offline copy of your repository so you can work offline on your device. A "pull request" needs to be done, when you worked on a separate branch and want to merge your new fatures with the main branch. Than you need to do a pull request, where the Team can give improvements or accept your featueres so you can merge both branches.

On this website you can find the NYC Taxi dataset. This dataset displays a random taxi during a day. It shows the stored coordinates of the taxi on a map of New York. It highlights the routes where the taxi was driving a passenger to his/her destination. I think this dataset is interesting because, if you can see all the taxis all over New York, you can analyze where NYC residents are during the day and use that data to create an evacuation plan.

Books:
The book I´m most interested in is called "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray (2013). This book is a kind of Step-By-Step guide to get started with data visualization. It gives a brief introduction to Javascript, HTML and CSS. It will provide the reader with many different example projects to get started.  
I´m interested in this book because I think that Big Data is useless if you are not able to visualize your results. It will always be important to know how to present the analyzed results out of hugh datasets.
