On this website you can find the NYC Taxi dataset. This dataset displays a random taxi during a day. It shows the stored coordinates of the taxi on a map of New York. It highlights the routes where the taxi was driving a passenger to his/her destination. I think this dataset is interesting because, if you can see all the taxis all over New York, you can analyze where NYC residents are during the day and use that data to create an evacuation plan.
